# ROME_1
ROME, VIRTUAL PET
This is a simple chatbot and a simple virtual pet. The intention of this project is to have a chatbot where you can communicate and interact with th chatbot.
For now this is just a simple MVP programm and all the features are not yet implemented.
I used chatterbot to create and train the chatbot and I used a flask web app to implement it so the user can have a chat with the program.
The landing page explains the chatbot features and I used REACT to create it.

For now this is just a simple website and it is still learning and some bugs(fixing this). I had some trouble writing a good training file. Still practicing,
I am currently working on improving the app and make it more interactive and I hope to implement a feature where the user can play games with the bot.
And create a better interactive page.

INSTALLATION
To run the app we open the landing page then run npm start
u can press the button to access the chatbot

USAGE

the chatbot is easy to use all you have to do is have a conversation with IT and it will reply.
